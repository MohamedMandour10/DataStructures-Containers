# Dynamic Memory Allocation in C++
## Overview
Dynamic memory allocation in C++ is a technique of allocating memory during the runtime of a program. In dynamic memory allocation, the memory is allocated at runtime, unlike the static memory allocation in which memory is allocated at compile time.

The dynamic memory allocation in C++ can be done using two operators:

* new operator
* delete operator
